# Outdated Hebrew Language Code for Android

This repo is a simple example of the issue I've encounted using the `expo-localization` package. On android, it returns an outdated ISO code for Hebrew `iw` instead of the new one of `he`. I checked this code on iOS and it does return `he` when run on an iOS device.
